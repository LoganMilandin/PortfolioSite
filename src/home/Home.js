            Hey, I'm Logan, a grad student at University of Washington and
            soon-to-be engineer. My intention for this site is to provide an
            interactive extension of my resum√©, plus a place to learn about my
            personal interests, so that recruiters and anyone checking out my
            LinkedIn can learn more about me. I'm working on a master's degree
            in computer science, which I'm finishing in Spring 2022, and I do
            some research and TA for the Allen school. My active hobbies include
            running and rock climbing (I made pages for these!), and I try to
            hike a few times a year. My less active hobbies include reading
            sci-fi and watching anime (I did not make pages for these). Click an
            item in the left menu to learn more!
