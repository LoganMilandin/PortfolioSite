              Hey, I'm Logan, a grad student at UW and soon-to-be engineer. My
              intention for this site is to provide an interactive extension of
              my resum√©, plus a place to learn about my personal interests, so
              that recruiters and anyone checking out my LinkedIn can learn more
              about me. I'm working on a master's degree in computer science,
              which I'm finishing in Spring 2022, and I do some research and TA
              for the Allen school. Some of my active hobbies include running
              and rock climbing (I made pages for these!), and I try to hike a
              few times a year. Some of my less active hobbies include reading
              sci-fi and watching anime (I did not make pages for these). Click
              an item in the left menu to learn more!
